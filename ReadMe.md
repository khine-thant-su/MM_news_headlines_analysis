### Context and significance behind the problem I am trying to solve

On February 1, 2021, the Myanmar military took over the government by conducting an unlawful coup. Since then, the country has been in turmoil, as the Myanmar military has responded to opposition by escalating violence against civilians and using other repressive tactics. Despite the countless attacks on unarmed civilians, extrajudicial killings, plunder, and sexual violence committed by the Myanmar military and police across the country, news about what is happening in Myanmar has seldom appeared in mainstream international media. Thus, a lot of international news readers are unaware of the current crises in Myanmar. Even fewer know to seek out news reported by Myanmar journalists, sometimes because they might not know what news sources exist, and what are reliable. 

In this project, I collected news headlines from https://www.myanmar-now.org/en/news to analyze news topics about Myanmar after the military coup. Myanmar Now is an independent news service published in both Burmese and English. Most of their reporters have Burmese names, suggesting they are likely Myanmar citizens. By analyzing news from Myanmar Now, I seek to understand if there are any difference in the types of news reported by foreign vs. Myanmar journalists on what is happening in Myanmar, and gain insight about important news from Myanmar which might not have been reported in mainstream international media.
