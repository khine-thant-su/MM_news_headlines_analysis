In this project, I collected news headlines from https://www.myanmar-now.org/en/news to analyze news topics in the first year after the military coup in Myanmar.

I plotted the number of articles published per month to see what months were most eventful, and what events were deemed newsworthy. I also created a wordcloud to analyze what words were most often featured in the news headlines. To extract meaningful words out of all the most featured words, I created a frequency dictionary without stopwords.
